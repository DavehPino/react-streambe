# To Do's

1. Santiago's photo apparently is restricted to access, it returns a 403 httpstatus code when sending a get request
2. Auth was implemented using Local Storage, it might be enhanced making it using some third party service or package
3. In case this app keeps growing, I would like to include a package to manage global state, it could be Redux or something alike
